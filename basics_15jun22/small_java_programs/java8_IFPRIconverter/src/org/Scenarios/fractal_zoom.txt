mamdelbrot ideas
    no playing: keeps things the same
    with playing: starts zooming in at constant rate (average tempo over 30 seconds)
    higher pitches: goes to more intricate, detailed parts of mandelbrot
    lower pitches: goes more to black regions, or to center of the zoom

1. understand how to generate fractal zooms
2. identify lowest and highest pitch in last 15 seconds of play
3. identify average tempo of music over last 30 seconds
4. move programmatically inside the fractal zoom
