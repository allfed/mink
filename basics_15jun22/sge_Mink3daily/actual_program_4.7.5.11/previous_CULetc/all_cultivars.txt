! Coefficients used in the Cropsim-Ceres model differ from those used
! in DSSAT Version 3.5 AND 4.0. They can be calculated (approximately) from 
! V3.5 coefficients as follows:

! P1V   = P1V(v3.5)*10 
! P1D   = P1D(V3.5)*20
! P5    = P5(V3.5)*20 + 430
! G1    = G1(V3.5)*5 + 5
! G2    = (G2(V3.5)*0.35+0.65) * P5/20
! G3    = G3(V3.5)*0.7 
! PHINT = PHINT(V3.5)

! Converted coefficients,and those listed below,should always be
! tested by using them with real experiments and comparing model 
! outputs with measured values.

! Coefficients used in the Cropsim model differ from those used in
! earlier DSSAT wheat/barley models. They can be calculated
! (approximately) from V3.5 coefficients as follows:
! VREQ  = P1V(v3.5)*10
! VBASE = 0.0          
! VEFF  = MAX(0.0,1.0-P1V(V3.5)*10/50)

! PPS2  = 0.0
! P1    = PHINT(V3.5)*4.2

! GWTS  = (G2(V3.5)*0.35+0.65) * P5/20
! SHWTS = G3(V3.5)*0.7
! PHINT = PHINT(V3.5)

! Converted coefficients,and those listed below,should always be

! some of the coefficients (eg.PHINT) may vary from region to
! region,and perhaps even from sowing date to sowing date,reflecting
! the current incomplete understanding of the environmental physiology
! of barley and other cereals.

! NOTE from K. J. Boote.  The PODUR in the following is ridiculously small.  That is impossible, with these highly
! indeterminate fruiting types.  Please look at the values used for CAL #5 and others for which we had pod and seed # over time
! PODUR values are between 15 to 30.  Likewise, the cowpea that I know has very short SFDUR.  The values below are too long
! UNLESS these are highly genetically different and yield really well like soybean does (up to 3000 kg/ha)?

! Coefficients used in the Cropsim cassava module differ from those used
! in the earlier DSSAT cassava model. It is best,therefore,not to attempt
! to convert 'old' coefficients, but to calibrate anew using the available
! experiments. And even with a fresh calibration,it is good practice to 
! test any set of coefficients by using them with real experiments that
! were not used for calibration,and then comparing model outputs to 
! measured values. 

! Users should also be aware that some of the coefficients (eg.PHINT) may 
! vary from region to region,and perhaps even from sowing date to sowing 
! date,reflecting not only the current incomplete understanding of the 
! environmental physiology of the crop, but also deficiencies in defining 
! the initial conditions and computing the microbial release of nitrogen 
! and other nutrients.

*MAIZE CULTIVAR COEFFICIENTS: MZCER046 MODEL
!
!The P1 values for the varieties used in experiments IBWA8301 and
!UFGA8201 were recalibrated to obtain a better fit for version 3
!of the model. After converting from 2.1 to 3.0 the varieties
!IB0035, IB0060, and IB0063 showed an earlier simulated flowering
!date. To correct this, the P1 values were recalibrated.
!The reason for this is that there was an error in PHASEI in
!version 2.1 that had TLNO=IFIX(CUMDTT/21.+6.) rather than
!TLNO=IFIX(SUMDTT/21.+6.); see p. 74 of Jones & Kiniry.
!-Walter Bowen, 22 DEC 1994.

!All G2 values were increased by a factor of 1.1 for Ritchie's
!change to RUE -Walter, 28 DEC 1994

!Obatanpa is low yielding (fertility constraints, or OPV)
!Yield "trait" is 5% higher RUE, 5% higher G2, 5% higher G3

!Base is bit higher yielding for tropical Africa, but somewhat lower yielding for
!USA,Europe,Argentina.  If you want to mimic those regions, Garst 8808 is better starting place.

*MAIZE CULTIVAR COEFFICIENTS: MZIXM046 MODEL
!
!The P1 values for the varieties used in experiments IBWA8301 and
!UFGA8201 were recalibrated to obtain a better fit for version 3
!of the model. After converting from 2.1 to 3.0 the varieties
!IB0035, IB0060, and IB0063 showed an earlier simulated flowering
!date. To correct this, the P1 values were recalibrated.
!The reason for this is that there was an error in PHASEI in
!version 2.1 that had TLNO=IFIX(CUMDTT/21.+6.) rather than
!TLNO=IFIX(SUMDTT/21.+6.); see p. 74 of Jones & Kiniry.
!-Walter Bowen, 22 DEC 1994.

!All G2 values were increased by a factor of 1.1 for Ritchie's
!change to RUE -Walter, 28 DEC 1994

! NOTE from K. Boote.  Annigeri (IB001) and JG74 (IB004) are the only ones that are calibrated with confidence.
! Other cultivars are left there for contrast.  In fact, values for Kabuli and Desi type and the others may no longer be good.
! Notice especially that SDPM and WTPSD had to be increased for Annigeri and JG 74.  So values for other cultivars may not be trusted

*PEANUT CULTIVAR COEFFICIENTS: CRGRO046 MODEL
!
! COEFF   DEFINITIONS
! =====   ===========
! EXPNO   Number of experiments used to estimate cultivar parameters
! ECO#    Code for the ecotype to which this cultivar belongs (see *.eco file)
! CSDL    Critical Short Day Length below which reproductive development
!         progresses with no daylength effect (for shortday plants) (hour)
! PPSEN   Slope of the relative response of development to photoperiod with time
!         (positive for shortday plants) (1/hour)
! EM-FL   Time between plant emergence and flower appearance (R1)
!         (photothermal days)
! FL-SH   Time between first flower and first pod (R3) (photothermal days)
! FL-SD   Time between first flower and first seed (R5) (photothermal days)
! SD-PM   Time between first seed (R5) and physiological maturity (R7)
!         (photothermal days)
! FL-LF   Time between first flower (R1) and end of leaf expansion
!         (photothermal days)
! LFMAX   Maximum leaf photosynthesis rate at 30 C, 350 vpm CO2, and high light
!         (mg CO2/m2-s)
! SLAVR   Specific leaf area of cultivar under standard growth conditions
!         (cm2/g)
! SIZLF   Maximum size of full leaf (three leaflets) (cm2)
! XFRT    Maximum fraction of daily growth that is partitioned to seed + shell
! WTPSD   Maximum weight per seed (g)
! SFDUR   Seed filling duration for pod cohort at standard growth conditions
!         (photothermal days)
! SDPDV   Average seed per pod under standard growing conditions (#/pod)
! PODUR   Time required for cultivar to reach final pod load under optimal
!         conditions (photothermal days)
! THRSH   The maximum ratio of (seed/(seed+shell)) at maturity.
!         Causes seed to stop growing as their dry weights
!         increase until shells are filled in a cohort.
!         (Threshing percentage).
! SDPRO   Fraction protein in seeds (g(protein)/g(seed))
! SDLIP   Fraction oil in seeds (g(oil)/g(seed))
!
! For typical cultivars, use TAMNUT for typical Spanish, FLORUNNER for typical
! runner virginia type, and FLORIGIANT for large-seeded Virginia runner type,
! EARLY BUNCH for early Virginia bunch type, and CHICO for earliest Spanish.
! These cultivars have been subjected to other calibration data sets.
! Of the above cultivars, Marc I and Southern Runner are also well tested.
! Those with "v tamn" or "v flor" or "v Ma" are presumed to be like TAMNUT
! or FLORUNNER or MARC I, with no testing done. NC7 and GK3 not tested.
! Cultivars 19-38 tested somewhat with Australian and India data, & 31-35
! also tested with some data at Gainesville.

*GENERIC SALUS MODEL PARAMETERS: SALUS046 MODEL
!
! Crop coefficients listed below (UF0001-2, MZ0003-4, PN0001-6 and CO0001-2) were estimated using observed data distributed 
! with DSSAT v4.5. The cultivars from the data were classified as "Early", "Medium" and "Long". Parameters estimated using
! limited or end-of-season measurements are labeled "Limited" and those estimated using detailed in-season measurements
! are tagged "Detailed" under the heading "VRNAME". A global sensitivity analysis (Dzotsi et al. 2013) showed low sensitivity
! of the SALUS-Simple model to variations in EMGINT, EMGSLP and TTGERM; therefore, the suggested default values in DEFINITIONS 
! below may generally be used. Ref. Dzotsi et al. 2013. Development, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the simple SALUS

!  Cultivar file for the CANEGRO Sugarcane Plant Module
!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!  It is recommended that for any new cultivars that need to be set up, the 
!  Nco376 cultivar be copied and modified.  Please ensure that values entered 
!  in this file are right-aligned to correct column heading.
!
!  Please modify parameters for your new cultivar in the order described above.
!  This is essentially the order in which the model performs the simulation.  The
!  phenology and stalk population parameters should be relatively easy to 
!  determine.  Only once these are correct should any attempt be made to calibrate 
!  the remaining parameters.
!
!  REAL values (with a decimal point) MUST be entered - e.g. 0., 1.23, 4.0
!
!  Please see DSSAT-Canegro documentation for guidance on parameter
!  determination.

! Coefficients used in the Cropsim model differ from those used in
! earlier DSSAT wheat/barley models. They can be calculated
! (approximately) from V3.5 coefficients as follows:
! VREQ  = P1V(v3.5)*10
! VBASE = 0.0          
! VEFF  = MAX(0.0,1.0-P1V(V3.5)*10/50)
! PPS1  = P1D(V3.5)*20
! PPS2  = 0.0
! P1    = PHINT(V3.5)*4.2
! P2    = PHINT(V3.5)*3*0.3   (V3.5P2*0.3)
! P3    = PHINT(V3.5)*3*0.7   (V3.5P2*0.7)
! P4    = PHINT(V3.5)*2       (V3.5P3)
! P5    = 80
! P6    = 0
! P7    = 120
! P8    = P5(V3.5)*20 + 430
! G#WTS  = G1(V3.5)*5 + 5
! GWTS  = (G2(V3.5)*0.35+0.65) * P5/20
! SHWTS = G3(V3.5)*0.7
! PHINT = PHINT(V3.5)

! Converted coefficients,and those listed below,should always be
! tested by using them with real experiments and comparing model
! outputs with measured values. Users should also be aware that
! some of the coefficients (eg.PHINT) may vary from region to
! region,and perhaps even from sowing date to sowing date,reflecting
! the current incomplete understanding of the environmental physiology
! of wheat and other cereals.
