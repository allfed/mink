wheat stuff, i just changed the version numbers in the original CUL/ECO/SPE and it works fine.

sorghum, the new ECO/SPE appear to have some additions and differences, so i
am putting those in as the ones to use, but leaving my original CUL since it
seems to have the same info.

executables are from ~/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop_13apr20/

compiled using ../compile_it_dssat_from_github_13apr20.sh which put everything in the right order to compile
along with a couple small changes.

all the CDE files from ~/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop_13apr20/Data

all the files in Data/StandardData

all the files from Data/GenoType

[rdrobert@ifpri2 Data]$ pwd
/export/home/rdrobert/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop_13apr20/Data
[rdrobert@ifpri2 Data]$ cp DSSATPRO.* ~/sge_Mink3daily/actual_program_4.7.5.11/

the DSSATPRO will need some editing to make everything refer to ./ so that we
just dump everything in a single directory and we're on our way.

soil files are carried along as they ever have been....
