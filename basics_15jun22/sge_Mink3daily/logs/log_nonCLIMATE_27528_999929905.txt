Beware the MAGIC ASSUMPTION!!! We assume that the geographic
location of the pre-existing weather files are lined up on multiples of
the provided spacings +/- 1/2 of a spacing. That is, suppose you have 1/2 degree
resolution. Then, we would expect points to fall on 0.25, 0.75, -0.25, 5.75, etc.
WARNING: org.DSSATRunner.SoilProfile assumes a fixed order for the values
Use dumpExampleProfile() to see an example of the order.
