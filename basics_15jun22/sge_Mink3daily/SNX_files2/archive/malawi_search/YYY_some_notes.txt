i'm going to start with maize. i want to define several automatic irrigation schemes.

mzMMMrrrainfed.SNX	rainfed (of course)
mzMMMirrigated.SNX	automatic to refill (based on soil moisture at 20cm, 40-100%)

then automatic (fixed amounts)

mzMMMirrig010.SNX	applying 10mm when too dry
mzMMMirrig020.SNX	applying 20mm when too dry
mzMMMirrig030.SNX	applying 30mm when too dry
mzMMMirrig040.SNX	applying 40mm when too dry

i'm going to use rainfed, 0.5 (1o2 = 1 over 2 = 1/2), 1, and 5 mm as the
irrigation application rates.

and, now i get to extend these to a whole stack of crops...

now, i am trying out three different maize varieties as proxies for
"local", "composite", and "hybrid"; this is based on advice from
kindie tesfaye (26dec15, 6:13am "RE: Malawi modeling questions")

hybrid = SC513
composite/opv = ZM521
local = some coefficients he put together, i am calling it MZLOCA
