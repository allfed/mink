i'm going to start with maize. i want to define several automatic irrigation schemes.

mzMMMrrrainfed.SNX	rainfed (of course)
mzMMMirrigated.SNX	automatic to refill (based on soil moisture at 20cm, 40-100%)

then automatic (fixed amounts)

mzMMMirrig010.SNX	applying 10mm when too dry
mzMMMirrig020.SNX	applying 20mm when too dry
mzMMMirrig030.SNX	applying 30mm when too dry
mzMMMirrig040.SNX	applying 40mm when too dry
