counting up delimiters

delimiter=","
delimited_string="a,b,c,d"
echo "$delimited_string" | awk -F "$delimiter" '{ print NF }'

echo "ASDF" | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]"

stripping directory structure from a full path
stripped_name=${full_name##*/}

an imperfect basic extension stripper
without_extension=${with_extension%/*.*}

converting a bunch of lines to a delimited string
asdf="a
b
c
d"

asdf_delimited=`echo "$asdf" | tr "\n" "," | sed "s/,$//g"` # the sed thing searches for trailing commas and replaces with nothing
