executables from ~rdrobert/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop
specifically: debug_dssat_02apr15.exe and fast_dssat_02apr15.exe

they will probably need to be renamed to be like dscsm046.exe to actually be used.

then, all the files (not directories) in
~rdrobert/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop/Data
(DSSATPRO.v46 was initially forgotten)

and the files in
~rdrobert/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop/Data/Genotype
~rdrobert/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop/Data/StandardData


DSSATPRO.v46 was edited to change everything from "C:\" to "./"
DSSATPRO.v46 was copied to DSSATPRO.L46

now, we may be having a problem with Simulation.cde not being SIMULATION.CDE,
so i am changing that.

yes!

ok, now i need to copy my cultivars into the appropriate cultivar files...
so, i really want to first compare the CUL/ECO/SPE to see which have
changed significantly such that my varieties would get screwed up.

RI rice --> all seem the same except phyllochron interval seems to be
            commented out in 4.6
WH wheat --> CUL is same, but ECO and SPE are different versus even the newer
             4.5; against the one we used for the "sika paper", the CUL is
             the same and the ECO and SPE have some big differences
MZ maize --> all seem ok, i need to copy over desired varieties
PN groundnuts/peanuts --> ECO seems the same, in SPE, the phosphorus has been
                          updated along with a few other things like rootrad
SB soybeans --> is exactly the same
SG sorghum --> phosphorus and rootrad changed
PT potatoes --> appears exactly the same

CS cassava --> totally different. whoo-hoo! maybe. i hope.
CH chickpea --> there appear to be significant differences...


-----------------
08apr15

trying to do a comparison of wheat/maize/groundnuts between my old 4.5
versions and this new nearly official 4.6

but... wheat is very different, so i first had to copy in the
global futures cultivars (which is fine), except they use a different
ECO code, so i will be trying to see what to do about that. likely
a copy/paste solution if possible.

they are sufficiently different that i will just reset the ecotype to
"default" in the CUL file since that is where it came from in the first
place....



-----------------
09apr15

i decided to modify the OPSUM.for file to get rid of the DAYLA and YPPM
running into their predecessors. that seems to be working nicely now,
but it did require a re-compilation...



=======================

07jan16

now, in theory there is a new version of DSSAT and the CIAT folks want
to use it for rice and beans. so, i have tried to compile it. we also
have a new cluster, so i re-installed the intel compiler in "evaluate
and activate later" mode since it didn't want to accept the serial number
anymore (you know, since we already used it once, probably).

i downloaded the latest DSSAT source a couple days ago and managed to get
it to compile with minimal changes (like, just telling it i wanted linux
options instead of windows ones). i am now trying to get it set up to see
if i can get it running and if it breaks my system due to new formatting
or anything....

so, the source code is in
~rdrobert/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop
(the old stuff got renamed as dssat-csm-develop_02apr15).

all i had to do was add "WH_module.f90" to the list of things to compile
first.

now, i am going to try to copy in all the supporting files we need.
(including the standalone weather generator...)

the weather generator needs: CO2_standalone.WDA and MODEL.ERR (the MODEL.ERR
will be overwritten by the new version...).


for the "code" files, i did this:

[rdrobert@ifpri2 Data]$ pwd
/export/home/rdrobert/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop/Data
[rdrobert@ifpri2 Data]$ cp *.CDE *.cde
~/sge_Mink3classic/actual_program_4.6_07jan16/

we need to rename the simulation.cde to "SIMULATION.CDE" or something.

also, let's dos2unix everything....

the "DSSATPRO.v46" file seems to be the same order and values as before, so i
will copy what i had previously with all the dos/windows paths cut out and
replaced by ./ and stuff.

[rdrobert@ifpri2 Data]$ cp ~/sge_Mink3classic/actual_program_real4.6/DSSATPRO.* ~/sge_Mink3classic/actual_program_4.6_07jan16/


and a new file of dubious need?

[rdrobert@ifpri2 Data]$ pwd
/export/home/rdrobert/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop/Data
[rdrobert@ifpri2 Data]$ cp DSCSM046.CTR ~/sge_Mink3classic/actual_program_4.6_07jan16/



of course, we need all the new cultivar/eco/species files [and then need to
check how much they have changed....].

[rdrobert@ifpri2 Genotype]$ pwd
/export/home/rdrobert/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop/Data/Genotype
[rdrobert@ifpri2 Genotype]$ cp * ~/sge_Mink3classic/actual_program_4.6_07jan16/


skipping the pest files because i don't think we need them...

i think we will be ok skipping the soils, too, as long as we copy over our
custom soil profiles.

and the standard data....

[rdrobert@ifpri2 StandardData]$ pwd
/export/home/rdrobert/DSSAT_source/dssat_from_github/dssat-csm-develop/Data/StandardData
[rdrobert@ifpri2 StandardData]$ cp *
~rdrobert/sge_Mink3classic/actual_program_4.6_07jan16/
