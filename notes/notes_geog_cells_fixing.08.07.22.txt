k. so.

Why is the java not going through the needed geographical pixels, and just doing all of them instead?

I want it to use the geog file I think.

The geog file should be only like 167 crop cells right? But then it's more like 289 cells. 

Writecopyblock is copying all 2k global cells, which clearly can't be correct. It's not even respecting the region, not even thinking aboutthe MAIZE_cropland!

This comes from the _geog file. How is that generated??

I think it might be the r.out.new script?

Alright. Changed all to_DSSAT to the basics.../sge... folder.

Now the Java runs the right things!

And occasionally, the things seem alright. But, sometimes they're not alright.


So now the situation:

cut -f20 chunks_to_GRASS/mzK019RF_379_Outdoor_crops_catastrophe_D__1_noGCMcalendar_p0_maize__eitherN250_nonCLIMATE_STATS.txt | wc -l
272

cut -f12 chunks_to_GRASS/mzK019RF_379_Outdoor_crops_control_D__1_noGCMcalendar_p0_maize__eitherN250_nonCLIMATE_STATS.txt | wc -l
235

cut -f3,4 to_DSSAT/D__1_noGCMcalendar_p0_maize__eitherN250_nonCLIMATE_geog.txt | wc -l
235


mzK019RF_379_Outdoor_crops_catastrophe_D__1_noGCMcalendar_p0_maize__eitherN250_nonCLIMATE_STATS.txt is full of 272 rows, not 235 as expected. Not sure why. Maybe because the cells in the us that don't have corn are not included??

how is this generated...?


So it's generated in Mink3p2daily for each lat/lon. So then, the loop through latitude and longitude is too many? In the meantime the geog file looks like it's generated at 235, maybe that's actually too little?

and then there's more than 300 DSSAT___ files... confusing, this must be fewer than 272?

Running again. There are, in fact, 235! So 235 seems like the right number.

I FIXED IT!!!! The problem was that I was looking at catastrophe, not control. Redoing for catastrophe....
