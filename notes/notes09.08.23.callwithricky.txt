automatic planting in DSSAT at bottom of x files (simulation block?)
can't do it for happy plant...

can set bounts for soil temp and soil moisture
 eg 5cm in the ground, temp no more than this, not less than that, moisture bounds set as well
originall for reasonable planting months for american states.
looking to not get frozen out and not muddy.
you can give it a window as well
you can say want it to happen during this time
doesn't give best yield, just very first day conditions are met
can add "f" or Force that puts in the ground


[SEPARATE QUESTION] okay so CSM? how to get substor etc?
[SEPARATE QUESTION] other model (apsim) for cold...
[SEPARATE QUESTION] should I use the 14 day limit on emergence then?

apsim

once was down at ufl
australia apsim guru
    tried to adapt mink to apsim
    (12 years ago)
    kinda sorta got it to work once
    was real pain
    joshua elliot has a tool for this

DSSAT has the potato model
crop code of pt does it!
"Ruby" made a good potato model (he'll send me)

temperature stress crop-by-crop would be a huge undertaking

he is pretty sure maize and wheat have cold weather things
he thinks has a "chilling degree days"


source code (some_settings script) 
he implenmented so can have planting window and can change in X file, so instead of given day, just use rules
he put a 14 day limit on emergence to account for dead seeds and squirrels etc

he suggests 2 weeks, and a moving average
I think moving average on either side should be good


he suggests just filtering things out later on if they are too low yielding.

happy plant is for phenology
the happy plant only, then planting of real planting, didn't really save much time. better to run everything and filter out at the end
he's reverted to saying we're planting same happy as real plant runs and run everything
