there seems to be some issue.
I want to figure out why when I run canola run, then canola process, it seems like there are no issues at all running, and then for some reason I'm not seeing all the planting months, even though it ran? 


so specifically,

"
done running generateRasterFromColumns script


running generateRasterFromColumns script


done running generateRasterFromColumns script

Invalid map <cnINVIGOR5440RF_379_Outdoor_crops_control_11_noGCMcalendar_p0_rapeseed__Aug10_updatedN_real_1>
Parse error
Error occurred in bash script: ./scale_raster.sh
Error occurred in bash command initiated from: BashScripts.java: line 468
The calling method was invoked from: Scenarios.java: line 1278
ERROR: process exited with value 1 (Error)
"

so cnINVIGOR5440RF_379_Outdoor_crops_control_11_noGCMcalendar_p0_rapeseed__Aug10_updatedN_real_1 does not exist as a raster.

however, cnINVIGOR5440RF_379_Outdoor_crops_control_3_noGCMcalendar_p0_rapeseed__Aug10_updatedN_real_1 DOES exist, as well as _5_
I don't get it, why this file is not being generated.

so,

this.raster_names_all_years_dry[i][planting_month_index][year_index] =
    this.snx_name[i]
        + "_"
        + this.co2_level[i]
        + "_"
        + this.weather_prefix[i]
        + "_"
        + this.yield_result_names[i][planting_month_index]
        + "_"
        + real_or_happy
        + "_"
        + this.years[year_index];
that is where the file is possibly stored?
I don't know if it's created here or just loaded.

Indeed, it is only loaded.
It is the very first function used in process to create the _wet_real_ raster with it (scaling it).

So there's something going on with mink3daily?
It used to generate this raster but now doesn't?
The git diff doesn't show anything different...

startKeyListener might be breaking things...
doesn't seem like it

okay, seems like actually the GIS raster creation needs to happen at the processing stage! So the issue is of course the processing itself is not running the "read" and creating any GRASS files for some reason.
