 Computing a quantitative index of association, covariation
 or correlation between an observed (O) and model-predicted
 (P) variate can take a variety of forms 

 d = 1 - [(sum from i=1 to N of (P_i - O_i)^2) / (sum from i=1 to N of (|P'_i| + |O'_i|)^2]
 where P'_i = P_i — mean(O) and O'_i = O_i - mean(O)

from that paper:
The default set-up was based on fixed planting dates for each grid cell from the Sacks et al. crop calendar64, with additional detail in the conterminous US provided by crop calendar data of the US Department of Agriculture100. All crops were first simulated using a range of cultivar phenology parameters and the cultivar which best reproduced the harvest dates from the Sacks et al. crop calendar64 was selected to be used in the default set-up. For maize, grid cells described in the SPAM2000 (spatial allocation model) dataset101 as “rainfed high input” or “irrigated” were assumed to use high-yielding hybrid cultivars, parameterized with 50% higher max grain number and 10% higher grain filling rate. Fertilizer levels in the default setting were the same as those used in the harmonized scenario (fullharm)37, with half applied at planting and half applied 40 days later. Wheat cultivar groups were selected based on mega-environments102 and then phenology parameters were calibrated as with other crops. Soybean cultivars were selected based on standard maturity groups and were then calibrated to reproduce Sacks et al.64 harvest dates3. In the fullharm and harmnon settings, growing periods of all crops were calibrated in the same manner to reproduce given GGCMI growing periods37.

by clicking "globus endpoint phase1" button here:http://www.rdcep.org/research-projects/ggcmi

actually the above doesn't help me much

in fact, nitrogen applied isn't reported?

table 4 and 6 are useful to understand the downloaded phase1 data.

so I'll extract wheat planting dates, Days from planting to maturity, and yield to see how my model is doing.
and that will help me run at a given planting date and see if my model matches theirs any better...
