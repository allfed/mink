We need to get grass and gdal working. Had to clone these:

git submodule add https://github.com/OSGeo/GDAL.git
git submodule add https://github.com/OSGeo/grass.git

in the dependencies.

Mink includes direct modifications to the grass repository and thus the source code is needed to get grass to work. Therefore I've added a git submodule to include the grass pull when git is pulled.
