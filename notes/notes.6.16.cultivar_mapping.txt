notes on my progress on mapping cultivars with defaults and all the resulting errors that occurred

other improvements relevant to june 16 commit



    We need to set it up so that default_cultivar_mappings is used if 
    cultivar_mappings is not specified in the simulation csv for potatoes, wheat, maize.

    In the case Canola, we already have everything setup for the mapping (canola only has one cultivar).

    In the case of Soybean, Soybean used will be the best of all cultivars. We already have the scenario setup for this.

    If cultivar_mappings is specified in the simulation csv, then it should be used instead of default_cultivar_mappings.

    If is not specified, then we want to implement a special java function which runs EITHER a new simulation for each megaenvironment, or runs a single simulation where each location already has its cultivar determined.
    This may involve downscaling the raster to the resolution of the weather files in order to pick the most appropriate cultivar for each location. (NEED TO CHECK THIS)

      The mapping from the file will beconverted to a HashMap<String, String>. where the first String is one of (maize, wheat, potato), and the second string is the raster (but actually, maybe a single cultivar has multiple rasters? Assume they're somehow combined for now (NEED TO CHECK THIS)).

        This entirely depends on whether it's possible to have the java mink3dailyrunner run a single simulation with different cultivars.
        Mink3Daily has:

        public static final String tempXFileName                    = "./deleteme.SNX";
        FunTricks.writeStringToFile(XHappyStuffToWrite, fullTempXFile);

        so then does StuffToWrite differ between grid cells? Where do we get this data?

        we have:

        ProcessBuilder pb =
            new ProcessBuilder(
                "bash",
                "./mink3daily_run_DSSAT_tile.sh",
                "/mnt/data/basics_15jun22/sge_Mink3daily/to_DSSAT/" + yield_result_name,
                weather_folder + "/" + weather_prefix,
                snx_name + ".SNX",
                fertilizer_scheme,
                co2_level,
                crop_name,
                "1",
                "0");

        and then basically what happens is a single run uses the X_file

        mink3daily_run_DSSAT_tile.sh

        to copy over just one SNX

        cp \${original_X_files_dir}\${X_template} \$X_dir

        which becomes

        cp /mnt/data/basics_15jun22/sge_Mink3daily/SNX_files/whNEWTONRF.SNX /mnt/data/on_node_home9159_927265190/DSSAT/X_files/


        the actual running of the tiles occurs at 

        org.DSSATRunner.MinkRunner3p2daily
        
        with this injected code:

        \$java_to_use "\$memory_string" -cp \$classpath \$classname \$on_node_runner_init_file 

        $on_node_runner_init_file only has one SNX.

        the key place this occurs is in the Mink3p2daily runner:


        System.out.println("-- starting through data --");
        for (int lineIndex = 0; lineIndex < nLinesInDataFile; lineIndex++) {

            latitude = geogMatrix.getValue(lineIndex,2); // Beware the MAGIC NUMBER!!!
            longitude = geogMatrix.getValue(lineIndex,3); // Beware the MAGIC NUMB

            ...

          
            //System.out.println("rundssat command");
            //System.out.println("./run_dssat.sh");
            ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("bash", "./run_dssat.sh");
            pb.inheritIO();
            pb.directory(pathToDSSATDirectoryAsFile);
            Process process = pb.start();
            process.waitFor();

        okay, so clearly only one SNX is run for a given on_node_home.

        The question arises:
          Do we run multiple cultivars in a single region and average the result, if we have a ratio between the likely amount of each cultivar? Are the maps even mutually exclusive at all? At such a low resolution, it may be naive to simply run one cultivar for a cell if we have reason to believe multiple cultivars are grown there.

          And what is currently being done?

          in MAIZE_maize_mask_MEs_28Aug13.sh:

            # now we need to do the division
            r.mapcalc $yield_rast = "$yield_rast / $count_rast" 2>&1 | grep -v "%"
          so it looks like we're averaging over the number of counts
          


      The HashMap will be used if the cultivar has not been set in the scenarios.

      IN THE CASE THAT EACH CULTIVAR IS A SEPARATE MAPPING TO RUN, once we have the cultivar map, we need to sum the result. Otherwise it should be set up properly. (ANSWER: YES< EACH ONE IS, AND HE DID THIS DIFFERENTLY, HE RAN IT AFTER THE FACT FOR EACH RUN FOR SOME REASON! SO I NEED TO MULTIPLY THE MASK BEFOREHAND)

    REMAINING QUESTIONS: Spring and Winter for wheat seem to have different processing somehow? I think I can just alter scenarios to account for this? It might already be taken care of. (I think this just comes down to different locations for winter and spring)

    ALSO we need to run the whole world! So this requires setting a different lat/lon max/min. HOWEVER, we should try just running a small region first like the US to see if the results are reasonable.


    OKAY!

    so I will for example, run through each cultivar, and have a list of (1,0) grass megaenvironment masks which need to be unioned together to get the regions that cultivar needs to be calculated (a (1,0) grass mask). Then, I get a smaller_crop_area_mask (also a (1,0) grass mask), where the smaller_crop_area_mask is the intersection of the crop_area mask and the unioned_megaenvironment mask.

    this union of megaenvironments, and subsequent intersection with the crop_area needs to be done before the initGRASS method is called

    method is completed.



    ###


    So, today (june 5) I got compile time things fixed with java but not runtime. Theoretically, if the resolution isn't an issue, it should find all the areas the crop exists, and then only run those (using megaenvironments). A given crop is already specified with spam, and then this map from the crop is overlaid with relavent megaenvironments for acultivar. I generate this megaenvironment_union by unioniing all the megaenvironments for a given cultivar. Then I intersect, to get the new smaller mask just for tha cultivar. It initializes with this in grass, and I should get a pretty picture, but there's a runtime error.

    next I need to fix the error, make sure nothing fishy is happening when we go from spam resolutioin to the larger crop resolution from the weather files (may need to use a resample command for example) by looking at the png, and then make sure to sum all the relevant yields in a given region, where the yield of each SNX file counts equally towards the total. So this probably means taking all the SNX and averaging.

    I also still need to check if SNX are being specified in the run, and if not, automatically find the relevant SNX for a crop with DSSAT.

    ###

    Today (june 6) I finished the creation of the scenarios from a basic yaml file.
    Probably should next add to the csvmonths and years and real or happy for each row, to make it complete. Things should now be set up to run this Scenarios.java, but I need to remember to replace area_raster with mask_for_this_snx, and make sure to set mask_for_this_snx equal to the area. 

    I need to figure out a way to ensure there's not too much region setting in the initgrassbuild... potentially I should just split up the initgrassbuild file into separate parts if there's lots of computationally heavy things that don't need to happen there.

    but the minimal thing to do next is just ensure the actual raster is being set properly and check that only nonnull raster elements above the minimum area reuirements are being run. 
    
    I need to make sure the scenario configs are logged somewhere automatically as well, when the scenario is actually run (the part that is time consuming and I can't just redo).


    At that point, I should be good to go with running first australia, then the whole world. 

    ### june 7
     everythingexcept the logging and the last point are basically done now
    3 errors
    Singularity mink_sandbox:~/Code/mink> ./run_from_csv.sh dssat
       >>> using dscsm_compiled_fast.exe <<<
    org/Scenarios/Scenarios.java:815: error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to String[]
              scenarios.month_result_name[i],
from
Singularity mink_sandbox:~/Code/mink> ./run_from_csv.sh dssat

    need to also check the final yield calcs arent using the weather_raster
    and that it all adds together properly between dssats... could be a problem if some are null, or all are null?

    also need to still check winterwheat is going properly (and potatoes, but thats less worrisome)

    ###
    there was a very hard to find bug (missing line in the build killing the nitrogen initialization raster, meaning run_dssat was failing)

    fixed it, now things are looking better

    Got my code working but there's a little issue: the REFACTORED for build_daily seems to have a parse errro

    ignoring the refactored, we have a small error iwth gneerating png's

    379_Outdoor_crops_control_BestYield_noGCMcalendar_p0_wheat__Jun13AUSmasktest_wet_averaged_RF@morgan_DSSAT_cat_0 has failed to exist

    I believe has to do with my conditions set in the  /home/dmrivers/Code/mink/scenarios/AUS/test_AUS_megaenvironments.yaml

    but otherwise wverything is working. Checked also: the averaging does not count null values. so masks should be good, avering all the non-null values. 

    once this is fixed, try to test if looks like old AUS results, then run the whole world!

    ### jun 14

    I fixed the parse error and pngs
    I reduced the printout statements greatly. it was unmanageable before, and now it's a lot but not completely crazy.
    some issues with --quiet though especially in r.mapcalc... not sure best way to quiet r.mapcalc.
    It looks like wheat is operating well so far as well, with similiar-to-correct-values as far as I can tell!

    Everything so far is working.

    Fixed the analyze_single_crop.py to plot out the results for a given mask.

    Succeeded in testing for all the planting months!
    
    ### 
    jun 15
    
    success in getting skipped dssat run rasters (in the case of 0 pixels) processed (just used the columns array, with some logic to just set a null)

    there was some issue in actually creating the rasters in these cases for some reason

    OK. So I ran the full MaIZE in AUS. Took 90 seconds to run and 160 second to process! So the process is slow because all the empty files I guess.

    Maize doesn't grow at all in aus (but does in one place in the phillipines/indonesia??. That seems highly suspicious. Maybe my min hectare thing is too stringent? 
    where it does grow the yield is fine.
    But actually also it's not even showing zero yield. which is fine, but good to keep in mind.

    So, next I'll figure out how he deals with winterwheat, and try to run the wheats to see if I get something reasonable. After that, I suppose I'll try the whole world, probably starting with canola. 

    So this is good, no bugs left as far as I can tell (but a lack of a feature (winter wheat), and some suspicious results)  


### jun 16

I fixed an issue with unioning megaenvironemnts

but still, If I run the cultivar like this:
mzK026RF,379,maize,Outdoor_crops_control,control_mink,wth_control,Jun15AUSmasktest,250,-8.4375,-44.0625,158.125,104.375,1.875,1.25,mask_for_mzK026RF,threeSplitWithFlowering
mzK026IR,379,maize,Outdoor_crops_control,control_mink,wth_control,Jun15AUSmasktest,250,-8.4375,-44.0625,158.125,104.375,1.875,1.25,mask_for_mzK026IR,threeSplitWithFlowering
mzK024RF,379,maize,Outdoor_crops_control,control_mink,wth_control,Jun15AUSmasktest,250,-8.4375,-44.0625,158.125,104.375,1.875,1.25,mask_for_mzK024RF,threeSplitWithFlowering
mzK024IR,379,maize,Outdoor_crops_control,control_mink,wth_control,Jun15AUSmasktest,250,-8.4375,-44.0625,158.125,104.375,1.875,1.25,mask_for_mzK024IR,threeSplitWithFlowering

or this

mzK026RF,379,maize,Outdoor_crops_control,control_mink,wth_control,Jun15AUSmasktest,250,-8.4375,-44.0625,158.125,104.375,1.875,1.25,mask_for_mzK026RF,threeSplitWithFlowering
mzK026IR,379,maize,Outdoor_crops_control,control_mink,wth_control,Jun15AUSmasktest,250,-8.4375,-44.0625,158.125,104.375,1.875,1.25,mask_for_mzK026IR,threeSplitWithFlowering

it gives me lots of nice outputs. 
but when I have the whole list of  maize cultivars, the output gets lower! That should never happen. I was thinking it was the nulls in the data, but now I think it's probably something to do with not entirely null data messing up the data pipeline in the averaging or dividing somewhere.

okay, the issue is between the wet_averaged_rf and wet_averaged_ir being good, but then the overall is actually bad! so it's combining things causing problems 

the algorithm to get overall from averaged:

Averaging all the crop cultivars produces a raster ending with "averaged_[RF or IR]".

Getting production is accomplished using the SPAM 2010 imported maps, which were previously saved as rasters ending in "_rainfed_cropland" and "_irrigated_cropland". The "averaged_[RF or IR][wet or dry]" yield rasters are multiplied by the irrigated or rainfed area to get a raster for rainfed production and a raster for irrigated production. This raster ends with "_production[RF or IR]".

Next, rainfed and irrigated production are summed in order to get a total yield for each cultivar. This raster ends in "_production"


if(scenarios.calculate_average_yield_rf_and_ir) {

  // sum rainfed and irrigated area rasters to the appropriate cropland
  BashScripts.sumRasters(
      script_folder,
      crop_area_to_sum,
      scenarios.crop_name[last_index_of_crop] + "_cropland", // to save here
      scenarios.results_folder[last_index_of_crop]);

  // use production and crop area to calculate average yield rf and ir
  // (just divide them as average yield is total production / total area)
  BashScripts.calculateOverallYield(
      script_folder,
      scenarios.scenario_tag_for_production[last_index_of_crop],
      scenarios.crop_name[last_index_of_crop] + "_cropland",
      scenarios.scenario_tag_for_overall_yield[last_index_of_crop]);

}

Finally, the production is averaged and the result os saved as "_overall"

1 scenario_tag_for_production
2 crop_area_raster
3 scenario_tag_for_overall_yields
r.mapcalc "$3 = $1 / $2"

this creates overall yield


ALRIGHT
figured out it happens between averaging and "production" rasters.

jun25:
what's confusing me:
I have two issues:
    first, I am getting only the first cropland (mask_for_this_snx) for each cultivar group and using it for averaging and production
    However! The cultivars actually have different values for their cropland. so a cultivar group for ir will just take the first cropland, which is a bad thing.

    second, i have an issue with the production png not even being created for ir, which doesn't make sense because it's being printed right before createpng. maybe because it's all nans or something?

    Addressing the first issue means that I actually, when averaging yields, and calculating overall yields, need to take into account the fact that there are different areas of different cultivars. 

        Take the example of rainfed area. 

        So, the area used to be the same for all cultivars -- i was trying to plant the cultivar in all the available places that crop could be grown (related to rainfed area). Then i was taking the average, without regard to crop area for all of them. then i found the production by multiplying yield by area, specifically rf or ir area by the average rf or ir yield .

        then i added the resulting productions together, and finally i calculate the overall yield by taking that added together production, and dividing by the crop area determined by summing the irrigated and rainfed crop areas together

            In Code:

            so i got the first cropland, equivalent to all other croplands for this crop and irrigation level (rf or ir)

            List<String> croplands = cultivar_groups_croplands.get(i);
            // assert verifyAllEqualUsingALoop(croplands);
            String cropland = croplands.get(0);

            then i got all the raster names in the cultivar group as a comma separated string

            List<String> rasters = cultivar_groups_rasters.get(i);
            String raster_names_to_average = getCombinedString(rasters);

            tthen, in averageAndCalculateProduction,

            BashScripts.runAverageCropsCommand(
                script_folder,
                raster_names_to_average,
                scenario_tag_for_averaging_rf_or_ir,
                results_folder);

            so, the rasters in that cultivar (all yields) were averaged together.
            so far so good, as we don't use the crop area

            but then, we have 

            BashScripts.calculateProduction(
                script_folder,
                scenario_tag_for_averaging_rf_or_ir,
                mask_for_this_snx,
                scenario_tag_for_production_rf_or_ir);

            which is taking the averaged scenario_tag_for_averaging_rf_or_ir, and multiplying this average yield by the crop area, but in this case it's just the crop area for the first cultivar of ir or rf.

            so this would be the production for ir and rf. then of course to get overall, we have scenario_tag_for_production_rf_or_ir, two for each crop, and sum them together

            this happens with thhe code below:

            note: 
            this.yield_result_name[i] =
                "BestYield_noGCMcalendar_p0_" + this.crop_name[i] + "__" + this.run_descriptor[i];

            this.scenario_tag[i] =
                this.co2_level[i] + "_" + this.weather_prefix[i] + "_" + this.yield_result_name[i]+"_"+wet_or_dry;

            this.scenario_tag_for_production[i] = this.scenario_tag[i] + "_production";

            so scenario_tag_for_production is specific to the crop, but theres only one for rainfed and irrigated
            but for indices i which have a given scenario_tag_for_production, there can be two unique scenario_tag_for_production_rf_or_ir, one rf one ir

            // Initialize an empty map to remember completed rf_or_ir tags
            ArrayList<String> completed_tags = new ArrayList<>();

            for (String tag : scenarios.unique_scenario_tags_for_production) {
              // loop through the unique crops

                String raster_names_to_sum = "";
                String crop_area_to_sum = "";

                int last_index_of_crop = 0;

                // loop through all scenarios
                for (int i = 0; i < scenarios.n_scenarios; i++) {

                  // only consider the scenarios which are running the current crop for averaging
                  // we only need to use the results from a given scenario tag once
                  if (!tag.equals(scenarios.scenario_tag_for_production[i])) {
                    continue;
                  }

                  // If the map does not already contain an entry for this scenario type, continue
                  // this allows us to find the data for a scenario tag
                  if (completed_tags.contains(scenarios.scenario_tag_for_production_rf_or_ir[i])) {
                    continue;
                  }
                  completed_tags.add(scenarios.scenario_tag_for_production_rf_or_ir[i]);

                  raster_names_to_sum =
                      raster_names_to_sum + scenarios.scenario_tag_for_production_rf_or_ir[i];

                  crop_area_to_sum = crop_area_to_sum + scenarios.mask_for_this_snx[i];

                  last_index_of_crop = i;
                }

            // sum rainfed and irrigated yield rasters to the appropriate scenario_tag_for_production
              BashScripts.sumRasters(
                  script_folder,
                  raster_names_to_sum,
                  scenarios.scenario_tag_for_production[last_index_of_crop], // to save here
                  scenarios.results_folder[last_index_of_crop]);

                if(scenarios.calculate_average_yield_rf_and_ir) {

                  // sum rainfed and irrigated area rasters to the appropriate cropland
                  BashScripts.sumRasters(
                      script_folder,
                      crop_area_to_sum,
                      scenarios.crop_name[last_index_of_crop] + "_cropland", // to save here
                      scenarios.results_folder[last_index_of_crop]);

                  // use production and crop area to calculate average yield rf and ir
                  // (just divide them as average yield is total production / total area)
                  BashScripts.calculateOverallYield(
                      script_folder,
                      scenarios.scenario_tag_for_production[last_index_of_crop],
                      scenarios.crop_name[last_index_of_crop] + "_cropland",
                      scenarios.scenario_tag_for_overall_yield[last_index_of_crop]);

                }



        but now, i am only planting the cultivars in the region where it has been determined the megaenvironment is suitable for them, rather than all area for that crop.

        in the rainfed case, rather than   assuming the area is the same for all cultivars and try to plant the cultivar in all the available places that crop could be grown (related to rainfed area), I plant just in the megaenvironments, and all the cultivar areas added together would represent the total crop area where the crop could be grown. 

        So essentially the difference is that each cultivar now has its own crop area, differing even when we're talking about two of the same species that are under rainfed, say. 

        HOW TO FIX THIS:

        To take the average, it would be exactly the same, as this does not call in the crop area at all, and because the average command ignores null values unless all values are null. in a given region, if there are multiple cultivars, the relevant cultivar yields are averaged together

        now, to take the production, we could consider multiplying each yield value by the crop are of the relevant snx. Recall that some SNX do in fact use the same crop areas as other snx (overlapping megaenvironments). As a result, the average yield would be over-estimated because both crops would be assumed to have the same area.
        furthermore this naive solution would over-estimate the crop yields when considering a mask_for_snx which is not broken down into different crop area rasters.
        I guess then we should check if the rasters are the same name, and any groupings of crop areas for a given irrigation level (rf_or_rf) and for  the group in question, we assume that we just multiply the average of that grouping by the crop area raster in question, and add this to the production.

        in the case that two mask_for_snx overlap but are not the same, then the production would be overestimated though.

        Is it actually true that mask_for_snx overlap though? I think they don't! the megaenvironments are mutually exclusive i think. if they don't overlap, then the above method works.

        well, it seems like they very well may...

        so another strategy is to take any individual crop areas and count the amount each cell is being represented by a map. in the case all rainfed are the same, then the count would be the number of cultivars. The yields should be added rather than averaged in this case. Then we divide by the count, giving us an equal weight to all cultivars which may grow in each cell in all cases, and ultimately simply multiplying by the crop area raster to get production.

        luckily, the actual crop_area rasters are all just multiplying the known irrigated crop area. so, they all have the same amount of area.
